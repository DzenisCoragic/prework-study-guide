# Prework Study Guide 

## A prework study guide for the Coding Bootcamp

The need for a clear, structured and a pleasing study guide is what motivated me to make a study guide. I made the study guide for the purpose of easier learning. It helps me to look up and look at each of the points that I learned during the prework.

## Usage

The prework study guide can be used for looking at notes that we write during the process of learning. In those notes we can also section off all of the different topics like HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. 
Also, we are able to see JavaScript running by opening the DevTools console. It will list the topics that we learned and choose one topic for us to study first.
