    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
      <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
      <li>The parent/child elements refer to elements being inside other elements.</li>
      <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tab.</li>
      <li>A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>CSS box model is a reference to the fact that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

    <h2>Git</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
      <li>Git commands, unlike other commands, always start with 'git'.</li>
      <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
      <li>Repository ("repo") is a folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history. Also every project on GitHub is called a repository.</li>
      <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
      <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Javascript</h2>  
    <ul>
      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>Variables may hold values that have different data types: string, number, boolean, array, object values.</li>
      <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
      <li>Some of the simplest operators are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, assignment, strict equality and Not, does-not-equal.</li>
      <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
      <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.</li>
      <li>Event handlers are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response.</li>
      <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. It essentially "locks down" what that variable will be.</li>
